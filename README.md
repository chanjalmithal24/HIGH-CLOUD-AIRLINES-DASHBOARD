The **High Cloud Air-Lines Analytics Dashboard** is an end-to-end business intelligence solution developed using **Excel, Power BI, and Tableau** to analyze airline operations, passenger traffic, route efficiency, and seat utilization.

The dashboard provides a consolidated view of key performance indicators (KPIs), trends, and comparisons, enabling data-driven decision-making for airline operations and strategic planning.

This project demonstrates practical skills in **data analysis, visualization, KPI reporting, and interactive dashboard design** using real-world airline data concepts.
